## 2026-10-14: v0.1.0, project start

Fresh Rust rewrite of the SC signature scanner idea. Plan and decisions are
from the project discussion with Alan.

Decisions:
- Template matching instead of general OCR (EasyOCR was ~180 ms per read and
  a 275 MB download; Windows OCR gave no confidence score).
- Per-glyph scores drive correction: only glyphs whose best and runner-up
  templates are within 0.08 may be swapped, and only to a value the signature
  table explains. This targets the 6 vs 8 misreads without "correcting" clear
  reads into unrelated values.
- The orange map pin is blanked by colour during grayscale conversion.
- Majority vote (2 of last 3 frames) before a value is shown.
- No manual image scan (old PING feature dropped).
- Signature table is plain JSON with a schema number, ready for syncing.

Added:
- `rockhound-core` with unit tests on synthetic digits.
- `rockhound-replay` (`frames`, `learn`, `eval`).
- CI: fmt, clippy, tests.

Smoke test on a synthetic noisy video (DejaVu Sans, ~13 px digits, orange
box as the pin): 110/110 labelled frames correct, no false reads on blank
frames, ~2.8 ms per read in release.
